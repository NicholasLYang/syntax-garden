# String literals

String literals are used to create string values.

## String interpolation

Strings are often constructed from other values. This construction can be done with a string concatenation operator, but this is often verbose and difficult to read.

**JavaScript**

```javascript
"hello " + name + ", it's nice to meet you"
```

Instead, string interpolation allows string literals to embed values with a special syntax, such as `${}` or `#{}`, creating more legible strings

**JavaScript**

```javascript
`hello ${name}, it's nice to meet you`
```

**Ruby**

```ruby
"goodbye #{name}, have a nice trip"
```

In most cases, the embed syntax is not actually restricted to variables. They can contain arbitrary expressions:

**JavaScript**

```javascript
`hello, ${getUser().name}`
```

This is ergonomic, but it creates some challenges for parsing and tokenization.
