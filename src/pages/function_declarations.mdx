# Function declarations 

## Named declarations
Most commonly, functions are declared as a statement with name and parameters.

C function declarations start with the return type, the function name, and then the parameters and body:

**C**

```c
void create_user(int id) {
  ...
}
```

Most languages today use a keyword to indicate a function declaration:

**Python**

```python
def create_user(id):
  ...
```

**Rust**

```rust
fn create_user(id: i32) {
 ....
}
```

There's a few reasons a keyword is preferrable. They can be grepped for quite easily, so it's easier to find function declarations. Also, the C style has an ambiguity where `int foo` could be the start of a variable assignment, i.e. `int foo = 10`, or it could be a function declaration `int foo()`.

## Anonymous functions

Functions can also be declared in an anonymous manner, i.e. an expression without a bound name that evaluates to a first class function value. 

**JavaScript**

```javascript
(a) => {
  console.log(a);
  return a + 1;
}
```

**Rust**

```rust
|a| a + 1
```
### Expression body shorthand

One common convenience for anonymous functions is letting the body be either a single expression or a normal statement block. When the body is an expression, the function returns that value. So in JavaScript, instead of writing:

```javascript
(a, b) => {
  return a + b
}
```

You can write:

```javascript
(a, b) => a + b
```

### Currying

Another nice effect of anonymous function syntax and the expression body shorthand is that it facilitates easy function currying. For example:

**JavaScript**

```javascript
(a) => (b) => a + b
```

### Optional names

In JavaScript, the regular `function` declaration form can be used as an anonymous function, as the name part is optional:

```javascript
foo.then(function (result) {
  ...
})
```
