Welcome to the syntax garden! The goal of this site is to categorize all the different elements and design decisions of programming language syntax, along with the implications of these decisions.

**This is very much a work in progress. All text is open to change.**

[Contributions](https://github.com/nicholaslyang/syntax-garden) are welcome, although with some general rules:

* The focus should be almost entirely syntax. Of course, syntax and semantics are intertwined, but when possible, focus on the syntactical forms.

* Avoid value judgements of programming languages. Individual syntactical elements can be compared, but avoid wholesale judgements of the language.

* Keep to a fairly neutral tone. No embellishment or exaggeration.
