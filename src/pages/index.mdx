Welcome to the syntax garden! This site aims to categorize all the different elements and design decisions of programming language syntax, along with the implications of these decisions.

**This is very much a work in progress. All text is open to change.**

[Contributions](https://github.com/nicholaslyang/syntax-garden) are welcome, although with some general rules:

* The focus should be almost entirely syntax. Of course, syntax and semantics are intertwined, but when possible, focus on the syntactical forms.

* Avoid value judgements of programming languages. Individual syntactical elements can be compared, but avoid wholesale judgements of the language.

* Keep to a fairly neutral tone. No embellishment or exaggeration.
